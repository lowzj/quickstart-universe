## üéØ Core Value

Quickstart Universe aims to drastically reduce the time spent on learning and deploying new tools from hours or even days to mere minutes. By leveraging AI to analyze Quickstart documentation, we generate one-click deployment scripts for various environments, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for new technologies and boosting productivity and the joy of exploration.

## üí° How It Works

1.  **Input:** User provides a tool name, the URL of a Quickstart document, or uploads the document directly.
2.  **AI Analysis:** Our AI engine parses the document, extracting key deployment information such as dependencies, configurations, commands, etc.
3.  **Script Generation:** Based on the analysis and the user's selected target environment, the corresponding deployment script is generated.
4.  **Deploy!:** The user obtains the script, reviews it, and can then quickly deploy the tool.

## AI Model Integration

The application has been updated to support content extraction from quickstart documents using various AI models. This allows for more sophisticated parsing of HTML content to identify key setup steps, dependencies, and configurations.

Placeholder implementations for the following AI models have been added to `app/services/content_extractor.py`:
- `GeminiExtractor`
- `GptExtractor`
- `LlamaExtractor`
- `DeepSeekExtractor`
- `ClaudeExtractor`

These are currently **placeholders** and do not make live API calls. To enable full functionality for any of these extractors, users would need to:
1.  **Install the respective Python SDK:** For example, for Gemini, you would install `google-generativeai`. A placeholder for this is in `pyproject.toml`.
2.  **Configure API Keys:** Securely manage API keys, typically via environment variables (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`) or a dedicated configuration file. The extractor classes would need to be updated to load these keys.
3.  **Implement API Logic:** Within each extractor class (e.g., `GeminiExtractor.extract`), implement the actual logic for:
    *   Initializing the AI model's client with the API key.
    *   Constructing an appropriate prompt using the input HTML content.
    *   Making the API call to the model.
    *   Parsing the model's response to populate the `ExtractedContent` Pydantic model.

### Configuring Gemini (Google AI Studio)

To enable the `GeminiExtractor` to make actual API calls to the Google AI Studio (Gemini API), you need to configure your API key:

1.  **Set the Environment Variable**:
    The `GeminiExtractor` expects your API key to be available as an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`. You can set this in your shell session or `.env` file:
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key obtained from Google AI Studio.

2.  **Dependency Installation**:
    The `google-generativeai` package, which is the Python SDK for the Gemini API, is now listed as a dependency in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `google-generativeai = "^0.5.0"`). Ensure it's installed in your project's environment. If you are managing dependencies manually or setting up a new environment, you might need to install it, for example, using a command like:
    ```bash
    uv pip sync pyproject.toml 
    ```
    (or `pip install google-generativeai` if you're managing packages individually).

If the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is not set, the `GeminiExtractor` will automatically fall back to using mock/placeholder data, and a warning will be logged indicating this. This allows for development and testing without requiring a live API key.

Currently, `app/main.py` is configured to use `GeminiExtractor`. This can be easily changed by modifying the `extractor` variable instantiation in `app/main.py` to use one of the other implemented placeholder extractors (e.g., `extractor = GptExtractor()`).

## Development Setup with `uv`

This project uses `uv` for package management and virtual environments.

1.  **Create/Recreate Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```
    This will create a `.venv` directory in the project root.

2.  **Activate Virtual Environment**:
    *   macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   Windows (PowerShell):
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Once the virtual environment is activated, install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`:
    ```bash
    uv pip sync pyproject.toml
    ```
    (Note: `uv sync` might also work depending on `uv` version and project setup.)


4.  **Adding New Dependencies**:
    *   To add a runtime dependency:
        ```bash
        uv add <package_name>
        ```
    *   To add a development dependency (e.g., linters, test tools):
        ```bash
        uv add --dev <package_name>
        ```

5.  **Running the Web Application**:
    Once dependencies are installed and the virtual environment is active, run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    This command should be run from the project root directory (the directory containing the `app` folder). The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Development Environment & CI/CD

### VS Code Configuration
This project includes recommended VS Code settings in `.vscode/settings.json`. These settings configure:
- The Python interpreter to use the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).
- Ruff as the default linter and formatter, with format-on-save enabled.
- `unittest` as the testing framework, with appropriate discovery settings.

Using these settings can help maintain code quality and consistency across collaborators.

### GitHub Actions
This project utilizes GitHub Actions for automation:
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: On every push to `main`/`master` or pull request targeting these branches, the CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) automatically runs linters (Ruff) and tests (`unittest`) across multiple Python versions.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: When a new version tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`) is pushed, the workflow in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` automatically builds the package and publishes it to PyPI. It also creates a corresponding GitHub Release.
